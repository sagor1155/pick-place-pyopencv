1. import pyqt4
2. use QThread for serial receive
3. use signal & slot to get data
4. Multithread
5. wait for input(com port) when program begins
6. create a function in Serial class for getComPort() which waits for COM PORT raw_input
   and stores the COM PORT name to a global variable within the class 
7. main function calls getComPort() function of serial class at the begining of the
   program, without valid COM PORT program doesn't starts and shows failure notification
8. create a command parser for Arduino to decode the commands from Python
9. determine ARM Center (Xc, Yc)
